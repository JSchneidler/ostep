1. First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it. Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you run this program?

    Seg fault

2. Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with the -g flag). Doing so letâ€™s put more information into the executable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information about variable names and the like. Run the program under the debugger by typing gdb null and then, once gdb is running, typing run. What does gdb show you?

    Basic program information (argc, argv), the line that caused the segmentation fault (including the invalid address).

3. Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but forgets to free it before exiting. What happens when this program runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?

    Nothing with lldb

4. Write a program that creates an array of integers called data of size 100 using malloc; then, set data[100] to zero. What happens when you run this program? What happens when you run this program using valgrind? Is the program correct?

    The program runs, but it is not correct. Index 100 is out of range, this is a buffer overflow.

5. Create a program that allocates an array of integers (as above), frees them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of the array. Does the program run? What happens when you use valgrind on it?

    The program runs, the freed memory seems to be zeroed out.

6. Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the array you allocated above). What happens? Do you need tools to find this type of problem?

    malloc fails at runtime, giving the error `pointer being freed was not allocated`

7. Try out some of the other interfaces to memory allocation. For example, create a simple vector-like data structure and related routines that use realloc() to manage the vector. Use an array to store the vectors elements; when a user adds an entry to the vector, use realloc() to allocate more space for it. How well does such a vector perform? How does it compare to a linked list? Use valgrind to help you find bugs.

    Dynamic arrays have faster indexing (constant time vs linear time).  
    Dynamic arrays have slower insertion/deletion (linear vs constant).
